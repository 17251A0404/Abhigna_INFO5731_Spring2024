Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.\", 'start war epic reminisc classic past open scene absolut spectacular see rome ugli side glori behind scene polit conspiraci corrupt part end caesar dead maximu slave lead two stori arc inevit meet maximu reveng odyssey commodu grand vision make rome greatth action scene hollywood touch hero alway prevail entertain nonetheless even though end feelgood plu focu isnt entir adventur also two main charact conflict themand charact come life thank great perform russel crow maximu joaquin phoenix commodu scene maximu find wife son murder especi one commodu find isnt chosen one father good examplesveri success job term set design movi look smell breath like ancient romeicon soundtrack thank han zimmer'], [\"Yes I was entertained Maximus.

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself. I feel like injured or not, no one in their right mind would've taken the decision to fight him 1 to 1, so for a cunning character, I feel he made an unrealistic decision there, but it did make for a very entertaining finish.\", 'ye entertain maximu plenti realist sword fight duel compar action film anyway immens storylin make passion support maximu aveng famili russel crow joaquin phoenix suit role perfectli hero villain simpl yet effect stori keep engag there much film could better might seem rate tad harsh howev might villain feel like injur one right mind wouldv taken decis fight cun charact feel made unrealist decis make entertain finish'], [\"I haven't watched Dutch a great movie in a long time...

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe\\'s Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life\\'s pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.', 'ridley scott gladiat perfect film would think hardiest fan im firmli one know deep yet like commodu film keen point virtu worthi gladiat film enough fact make everlast favourit genr fan worthi academi award acknowledg receivedin narr term plot stori arc simplic suprem someth scott russel crow never shi away knowledg well never denial debt gladiat owe anthoni mann epic fall roman empir folk seem irrit strang maker gladiat stand bold brass proclaim uniqu movi reinvigor stagnant genr film new gener audienc bloodi work influenc interest thing roman histor swashbuckl film follow post gladiat success seewhat life echo eternityso origin stori cgi hardli grade stuff there littl mug act support rank cast struggl grasp period set requir yet way gladiat make emot commit feel overrid film make irk crow maximu man men want man woman want run gamut life pain emot fortifi trial tribul everi step way urg toward day reveng splatter destini crow superb everi pain frame win academi award best actor insid previou year'], [\"I watched this movie in 2000 in a movie theater.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character\\'s emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That\\'s far from nothing.', 'let prefac mention someth ridley scott fanboy hold probabl higher pantheon modern filmmak dont mind admit howev one film seem step direct audienc feel neg toward posit probabl one film he prais gladiat ive sever view past coupl decad begin sort im disengag larg swath film think write downth stori spanish gener maximu russel crow built well ill say script john logan david franzoni william nicholson structur point need tell stori reveng there earli glori emperor marcu aureliu richard harri unjust fall hand commodu joaquin phoenix rebirth gladiatori game provinc ownership proximo oliv reed revel back forth toward reveng end yet cant connect ive lay blame film tone recent view refin criticismfirstli tone remark dour bare happi moment throughout exceedingli rare leav rest film oppress sen dour root idea film bandi cours begin fact maximu famili murder corrupt emperor kill father gain throne think one center problem tone lucilla conni nielsen commodu sister maximu previou relationship year ago seem kind feminin respit masculin around she almost written like man outsid look she terribl feminin hard cold even begin given one moment smile laugh maximu expens otherwis much respit form miseri around even maximu she never potenti alli dark danger gameth time film lighten tone action sequenc gener pretti great scott qualiti action filmmak understand point spectacl achiev battl germania fight africa gladiatori bout coliseum expertli stage film film begin strong recreat roman battl tactic help han zimmer lisa gerrard rous score get lost dour tone machin roman senateand lead second main critic polit there point later commodu quizz lucilla peopl rome like distant victori repli glori rome idea definit larger plot film return glori rome preimperi state republ without emperor okay fine never make case preimperi state better way current state never dig maximu care beyond fact die wish marcu aureliu would real one want doesnt matter movieand lead think core issu film maximu strong reason want plot actual want reveng commodu enough there effort wrap effort senat led gracchu derek jacobi commodu return power senat pervers incent commodu point suppos ignor reason maximu care marcu aureliu told care essenti real disconnect film present charact interact plot film never actual reconcilesand yet think film pretti okay mostli spectacl front give film full mark look great begin end there painterli approach visual help small part scott penchant use smoke machin everywher ever make film im use smoke machin ridley scott fault action scene topnotch perform everyon commit effect special mention phoenix goe commodu demonstr descent mad paranoia welli engag stori much weird combin superseri roman polit assum presumpt like shout democraci crowd expect cheer odd disconnect main charact plot that unfold around know film legion fan will go arena defend film honor anyon would besmirch besmirch done weird stori man dont think realli work wellmad fun spot look great that far noth'], [\"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character\\'s emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That\\'s far from nothing.', 'let prefac mention someth ridley scott fanboy hold probabl higher pantheon modern filmmak dont mind admit howev one film seem step direct audienc feel neg toward posit probabl one film he prais gladiat ive sever view past coupl decad begin sort im disengag larg swath film think write downth stori spanish gener maximu russel crow built well ill say script john logan david franzoni william nicholson structur point need tell stori reveng there earli glori emperor marcu aureliu richard harri unjust fall hand commodu joaquin phoenix rebirth gladiatori game provinc ownership proximo oliv reed revel back forth toward reveng end yet cant connect ive lay blame film tone recent view refin criticismfirstli tone remark dour bare happi moment throughout exceedingli rare leav rest film oppress sen dour root idea film bandi cours begin fact maximu famili murder corrupt emperor kill father gain throne think one center problem tone lucilla conni nielsen commodu sister maximu previou relationship year ago seem kind feminin respit masculin around she almost written like man outsid look she terribl feminin hard cold even begin given one moment smile laugh maximu expens otherwis much respit form miseri around even maximu she never potenti alli dark danger gameth time film lighten tone action sequenc gener pretti great scott qualiti action filmmak understand point spectacl achiev battl germania fight africa gladiatori bout coliseum expertli stage film film begin strong recreat roman battl tactic help han zimmer lisa gerrard rous score get lost dour tone machin roman senateand lead second main critic polit there point later commodu quizz lucilla peopl rome like distant victori repli glori rome idea definit larger plot film return glori rome preimperi state republ without emperor okay fine never make case preimperi state better way current state never dig maximu care beyond fact die wish marcu aureliu would real one want doesnt matter movieand lead think core issu film maximu strong reason want plot actual want reveng commodu enough there effort wrap effort senat led gracchu derek jacobi commodu return power senat pervers incent commodu point suppos ignor reason maximu care marcu aureliu told care essenti real disconnect film present charact interact plot film never actual reconcilesand yet think film pretti okay mostli spectacl front give film full mark look great begin end there painterli approach visual help small part scott penchant use smoke machin everywher ever make film im use smoke machin ridley scott fault action scene topnotch perform everyon commit effect special mention phoenix goe commodu demonstr descent mad paranoia welli engag stori much weird combin superseri roman polit assum presumpt like shout democraci crowd expect cheer odd disconnect main charact plot that unfold around know film legion fan will go arena defend film honor anyon would besmirch besmirch done weird stori man dont think realli work wellmad fun spot look great that far noth'], [\"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character\\'s emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That\\'s far from nothing.', 'let prefac mention someth ridley scott fanboy hold probabl higher pantheon modern filmmak dont mind admit howev one film seem step direct audienc feel neg toward posit probabl one film he prais gladiat ive sever view past coupl decad begin sort im disengag larg swath film think write downth stori spanish gener maximu russel crow built well ill say script john logan david franzoni william nicholson structur point need tell stori reveng there earli glori emperor marcu aureliu richard harri unjust fall hand commodu joaquin phoenix rebirth gladiatori game provinc ownership proximo oliv reed revel back forth toward reveng end yet cant connect ive lay blame film tone recent view refin criticismfirstli tone remark dour bare happi moment throughout exceedingli rare leav rest film oppress sen dour root idea film bandi cours begin fact maximu famili murder corrupt emperor kill father gain throne think one center problem tone lucilla conni nielsen commodu sister maximu previou relationship year ago seem kind feminin respit masculin around she almost written like man outsid look she terribl feminin hard cold even begin given one moment smile laugh maximu expens otherwis much respit form miseri around even maximu she never potenti alli dark danger gameth time film lighten tone action sequenc gener pretti great scott qualiti action filmmak understand point spectacl achiev battl germania fight africa gladiatori bout coliseum expertli stage film film begin strong recreat roman battl tactic help han zimmer lisa gerrard rous score get lost dour tone machin roman senateand lead second main critic polit there point later commodu quizz lucilla peopl rome like distant victori repli glori rome idea definit larger plot film return glori rome preimperi state republ without emperor okay fine never make case preimperi state better way current state never dig maximu care beyond fact die wish marcu aureliu would real one want doesnt matter movieand lead think core issu film maximu strong reason want plot actual want reveng commodu enough there effort wrap effort senat led gracchu derek jacobi commodu return power senat pervers incent commodu point suppos ignor reason maximu care marcu aureliu told care essenti real disconnect film present charact interact plot film never actual reconcilesand yet think film pretti okay mostli spectacl front give film full mark look great begin end there painterli approach visual help small part scott penchant use smoke machin everywher ever make film im use smoke machin ridley scott fault action scene topnotch perform everyon commit effect special mention phoenix goe commodu demonstr descent mad paranoia welli engag stori much weird combin superseri roman polit assum presumpt like shout democraci crowd expect cheer odd disconnect main charact plot that unfold around know film legion fan will go arena defend film honor anyon would besmirch besmirch done weird stori man dont think realli work wellmad fun spot look great that far noth'], [\"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character\\'s emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That\\'s far from nothing.', 'let prefac mention someth ridley scott fanboy hold probabl higher pantheon modern filmmak dont mind admit howev one film seem step direct audienc feel neg toward posit probabl one film he prais gladiat ive sever view past coupl decad begin sort im disengag larg swath film think write downth stori spanish gener maximu russel crow built well ill say script john logan david franzoni william nicholson structur point need tell stori reveng there earli glori emperor marcu aureliu richard harri unjust fall hand commodu joaquin phoenix rebirth gladiatori game provinc ownership proximo oliv reed revel back forth toward reveng end yet cant connect ive lay blame film tone recent view refin criticismfirstli tone remark dour bare happi moment throughout exceedingli rare leav rest film oppress sen dour root idea film bandi cours begin fact maximu famili murder corrupt emperor kill father gain throne think one center problem tone lucilla conni nielsen commodu sister maximu previou relationship year ago seem kind feminin respit masculin around she almost written like man outsid look she terribl feminin hard cold even begin given one moment smile laugh maximu expens otherwis much respit form miseri around even maximu she never potenti alli dark danger gameth time film lighten tone action sequenc gener pretti great scott qualiti action filmmak understand point spectacl achiev battl germania fight africa gladiatori bout coliseum expertli stage film film begin strong recreat roman battl tactic help han zimmer lisa gerrard rous score get lost dour tone machin roman senateand lead second main critic polit there point later commodu quizz lucilla peopl rome like distant victori repli glori rome idea definit larger plot film return glori rome preimperi state republ without emperor okay fine never make case preimperi state better way current state never dig maximu care beyond fact die wish marcu aureliu would real one want doesnt matter movieand lead think core issu film maximu strong reason want plot actual want reveng commodu enough there effort wrap effort senat led gracchu derek jacobi commodu return power senat pervers incent commodu point suppos ignor reason maximu care marcu aureliu told care essenti real disconnect film present charact interact plot film never actual reconcilesand yet think film pretti okay mostli spectacl front give film full mark look great begin end there painterli approach visual help small part scott penchant use smoke machin everywher ever make film im use smoke machin ridley scott fault action scene topnotch perform everyon commit effect special mention phoenix goe commodu demonstr descent mad paranoia welli engag stori much weird combin superseri roman polit assum presumpt like shout democraci crowd expect cheer odd disconnect main charact plot that unfold around know film legion fan will go arena defend film honor anyon would besmirch besmirch done weird stori man dont think realli work wellmad fun spot look great that far noth'], [\"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character\\'s emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That\\'s far from nothing.', 'let prefac mention someth ridley scott fanboy hold probabl higher pantheon modern filmmak dont mind admit howev one film seem step direct audienc feel neg toward posit probabl one film he prais gladiat ive sever view past coupl decad begin sort im disengag larg swath film think write downth stori spanish gener maximu russel crow built well ill say script john logan david franzoni william nicholson structur point need tell stori reveng there earli glori emperor marcu aureliu richard harri unjust fall hand commodu joaquin phoenix rebirth gladiatori game provinc ownership proximo oliv reed revel back forth toward reveng end yet cant connect ive lay blame film tone recent view refin criticismfirstli tone remark dour bare happi moment throughout exceedingli rare leav rest film oppress sen dour root idea film bandi cours begin fact maximu famili murder corrupt emperor kill father gain throne think one center problem tone lucilla conni nielsen commodu sister maximu previou relationship year ago seem kind feminin respit masculin around she almost written like man outsid look she terribl feminin hard cold even begin given one moment smile laugh maximu expens otherwis much respit form miseri around even maximu she never potenti alli dark danger gameth time film lighten tone action sequenc gener pretti great scott qualiti action filmmak understand point spectacl achiev battl germania fight africa gladiatori bout coliseum expertli stage film film begin strong recreat roman battl tactic help han zimmer lisa gerrard rous score get lost dour tone machin roman senateand lead second main critic polit there point later commodu quizz lucilla peopl rome like distant victori repli glori rome idea definit larger plot film return glori rome preimperi state republ without emperor okay fine never make case preimperi state better way current state never dig maximu care beyond fact die wish marcu aureliu would real one want doesnt matter movieand lead think core issu film maximu strong reason want plot actual want reveng commodu enough there effort wrap effort senat led gracchu derek jacobi commodu return power senat pervers incent commodu point suppos ignor reason maximu care marcu aureliu told care essenti real disconnect film present charact interact plot film never actual reconcilesand yet think film pretti okay mostli spectacl front give film full mark look great begin end there painterli approach visual help small part scott penchant use smoke machin everywher ever make film im use smoke machin ridley scott fault action scene topnotch perform everyon commit effect special mention phoenix goe commodu demonstr descent mad paranoia welli engag stori much weird combin superseri roman polit assum presumpt like shout democraci crowd expect cheer odd disconnect main charact plot that unfold around know film legion fan will go arena defend film honor anyon would besmirch besmirch done weird stori man dont think realli work wellmad fun spot look great that far noth'], [\"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character\\'s emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That\\'s far from nothing.', 'let prefac mention someth ridley scott fanboy hold probabl higher pantheon modern filmmak dont mind admit howev one film seem step direct audienc feel neg toward posit probabl one film he prais gladiat ive sever view past coupl decad begin sort im disengag larg swath film think write downth stori spanish gener maximu russel crow built well ill say script john logan david franzoni william nicholson structur point need tell stori reveng there earli glori emperor marcu aureliu richard harri unjust fall hand commodu joaquin phoenix rebirth gladiatori game provinc ownership proximo oliv reed revel back forth toward reveng end yet cant connect ive lay blame film tone recent view refin criticismfirstli tone remark dour bare happi moment throughout exceedingli rare leav rest film oppress sen dour root idea film bandi cours begin fact maximu famili murder corrupt emperor kill father gain throne think one center problem tone lucilla conni nielsen commodu sister maximu previou relationship year ago seem kind feminin respit masculin around she almost written like man outsid look she terribl feminin hard cold even begin given one moment smile laugh maximu expens otherwis much respit form miseri around even maximu she never potenti alli dark danger gameth time film lighten tone action sequenc gener pretti great scott qualiti action filmmak understand point spectacl achiev battl germania fight africa gladiatori bout coliseum expertli stage film film begin strong recreat roman battl tactic help han zimmer lisa gerrard rous score get lost dour tone machin roman senateand lead second main critic polit there point later commodu quizz lucilla peopl rome like distant victori repli glori rome idea definit larger plot film return glori rome preimperi state republ without emperor okay fine never make case preimperi state better way current state never dig maximu care beyond fact die wish marcu aureliu would real one want doesnt matter movieand lead think core issu film maximu strong reason want plot actual want reveng commodu enough there effort wrap effort senat led gracchu derek jacobi commodu return power senat pervers incent commodu point suppos ignor reason maximu care marcu aureliu told care essenti real disconnect film present charact interact plot film never actual reconcilesand yet think film pretti okay mostli spectacl front give film full mark look great begin end there painterli approach visual help small part scott penchant use smoke machin everywher ever make film im use smoke machin ridley scott fault action scene topnotch perform everyon commit effect special mention phoenix goe commodu demonstr descent mad paranoia welli engag stori much weird combin superseri roman polit assum presumpt like shout democraci crowd expect cheer odd disconnect main charact plot that unfold around know film legion fan will go arena defend film honor anyon would besmirch besmirch done weird stori man dont think realli work wellmad fun spot look great that far noth'], [\"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character\\'s emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That\\'s far from nothing.', 'let prefac mention someth ridley scott fanboy hold probabl higher pantheon modern filmmak dont mind admit howev one film seem step direct audienc feel neg toward posit probabl one film he prais gladiat ive sever view past coupl decad begin sort im disengag larg swath film think write downth stori spanish gener maximu russel crow built well ill say script john logan david franzoni william nicholson structur point need tell stori reveng there earli glori emperor marcu aureliu richard harri unjust fall hand commodu joaquin phoenix rebirth gladiatori game provinc ownership proximo oliv reed revel back forth toward reveng end yet cant connect ive lay blame film tone recent view refin criticismfirstli tone remark dour bare happi moment throughout exceedingli rare leav rest film oppress sen dour root idea film bandi cours begin fact maximu famili murder corrupt emperor kill father gain throne think one center problem tone lucilla conni nielsen commodu sister maximu previou relationship year ago seem kind feminin respit masculin around she almost written like man outsid look she terribl feminin hard cold even begin given one moment smile laugh maximu expens otherwis much respit form miseri around even maximu she never potenti alli dark danger gameth time film lighten tone action sequenc gener pretti great scott qualiti action filmmak understand point spectacl achiev battl germania fight africa gladiatori bout coliseum expertli stage film film begin strong recreat roman battl tactic help han zimmer lisa gerrard rous score get lost dour tone machin roman senateand lead second main critic polit there point later commodu quizz lucilla peopl rome like distant victori repli glori rome idea definit larger plot film return glori rome preimperi state republ without emperor okay fine never make case preimperi state better way current state never dig maximu care beyond fact die wish marcu aureliu would real one want doesnt matter movieand lead think core issu film maximu strong reason want plot actual want reveng commodu enough there effort wrap effort senat led gracchu derek jacobi commodu return power senat pervers incent commodu point suppos ignor reason maximu care marcu aureliu told care essenti real disconnect film present charact interact plot film never actual reconcilesand yet think film pretti okay mostli spectacl front give film full mark look great begin end there painterli approach visual help small part scott penchant use smoke machin everywher ever make film im use smoke machin ridley scott fault action scene topnotch perform everyon commit effect special mention phoenix goe commodu demonstr descent mad paranoia welli engag stori much weird combin superseri roman polit assum presumpt like shout democraci crowd expect cheer odd disconnect main charact plot that unfold around know film legion fan will go arena defend film honor anyon would besmirch besmirch done weird stori man dont think realli work wellmad fun spot look great that far noth'], [\"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character\\'s emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That\\'s far from nothing.', 'let prefac mention someth ridley scott fanboy hold probabl higher pantheon modern filmmak dont mind admit howev one film seem step direct audienc feel neg toward posit probabl one film he prais gladiat ive sever view past coupl decad begin sort im disengag larg swath film think write downth stori spanish gener maximu russel crow built well ill say script john logan david franzoni william nicholson structur point need tell stori reveng there earli glori emperor marcu aureliu richard harri unjust fall hand commodu joaquin phoenix rebirth gladiatori game provinc ownership proximo oliv reed revel back forth toward reveng end yet cant connect ive lay blame film tone recent view refin criticismfirstli tone remark dour bare happi moment throughout exceedingli rare leav rest film oppress sen dour root idea film bandi cours begin fact maximu famili murder corrupt emperor kill father gain throne think one center problem tone lucilla conni nielsen commodu sister maximu previou relationship year ago seem kind feminin respit masculin around she almost written like man outsid look she terribl feminin hard cold even begin given one moment smile laugh maximu expens otherwis much respit form miseri around even maximu she never potenti alli dark danger gameth time film lighten tone action sequenc gener pretti great scott qualiti action filmmak understand point spectacl achiev battl germania fight africa gladiatori bout coliseum expertli stage film film begin strong recreat roman battl tactic help han zimmer lisa gerrard rous score get lost dour tone machin roman senateand lead second main critic polit there point later commodu quizz lucilla peopl rome like distant victori repli glori rome idea definit larger plot film return glori rome preimperi state republ without emperor okay fine never make case preimperi state better way current state never dig maximu care beyond fact die wish marcu aureliu would real one want doesnt matter movieand lead think core issu film maximu strong reason want plot actual want reveng commodu enough there effort wrap effort senat led gracchu derek jacobi commodu return power senat pervers incent commodu point suppos ignor reason maximu care marcu aureliu told care essenti real disconnect film present charact interact plot film never actual reconcilesand yet think film pretti okay mostli spectacl front give film full mark look great begin end there painterli approach visual help small part scott penchant use smoke machin everywher ever make film im use smoke machin ridley scott fault action scene topnotch perform everyon commit effect special mention phoenix goe commodu demonstr descent mad paranoia welli engag stori much weird combin superseri roman polit assum presumpt like shout democraci crowd expect cheer odd disconnect main charact plot that unfold around know film legion fan will go arena defend film honor anyon would besmirch besmirch done weird stori man dont think realli work wellmad fun spot look great that far noth'], [\"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character\\'s emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That\\'s far from nothing.', 'let prefac mention someth ridley scott fanboy hold probabl higher pantheon modern filmmak dont mind admit howev one film seem step direct audienc feel neg toward posit probabl one film he prais gladiat ive sever view past coupl decad begin sort im disengag larg swath film think write downth stori spanish gener maximu russel crow built well ill say script john logan david franzoni william nicholson structur point need tell stori reveng there earli glori emperor marcu aureliu richard harri unjust fall hand commodu joaquin phoenix rebirth gladiatori game provinc ownership proximo oliv reed revel back forth toward reveng end yet cant connect ive lay blame film tone recent view refin criticismfirstli tone remark dour bare happi moment throughout exceedingli rare leav rest film oppress sen dour root idea film bandi cours begin fact maximu famili murder corrupt emperor kill father gain throne think one center problem tone lucilla conni nielsen commodu sister maximu previou relationship year ago seem kind feminin respit masculin around she almost written like man outsid look she terribl feminin hard cold even begin given one moment smile laugh maximu expens otherwis much respit form miseri around even maximu she never potenti alli dark danger gameth time film lighten tone action sequenc gener pretti great scott qualiti action filmmak understand point spectacl achiev battl germania fight africa gladiatori bout coliseum expertli stage film film begin strong recreat roman battl tactic help han zimmer lisa gerrard rous score get lost dour tone machin roman senateand lead second main critic polit there point later commodu quizz lucilla peopl rome like distant victori repli glori rome idea definit larger plot film return glori rome preimperi state republ without emperor okay fine never make case preimperi state better way current state never dig maximu care beyond fact die wish marcu aureliu would real one want doesnt matter movieand lead think core issu film maximu strong reason want plot actual want reveng commodu enough there effort wrap effort senat led gracchu derek jacobi commodu return power senat pervers incent commodu point suppos ignor reason maximu care marcu aureliu told care essenti real disconnect film present charact interact plot film never actual reconcilesand yet think film pretti okay mostli spectacl front give film full mark look great begin end there painterli approach visual help small part scott penchant use smoke machin everywher ever make film im use smoke machin ridley scott fault action scene topnotch perform everyon commit effect special mention phoenix goe commodu demonstr descent mad paranoia welli engag stori much weird combin superseri roman polit assum presumpt like shout democraci crowd expect cheer odd disconnect main charact plot that unfold around know film legion fan will go arena defend film honor anyon would besmirch besmirch done weird stori man dont think realli work wellmad fun spot look great that far noth'], [\"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character\\'s emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\\'s success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there\\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks.

As he runs through the gamut of life\\'s pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.', 'ridley scott gladiat perfect film would think hardiest fan im firmli one know deep yet like commodu film keen point virtu worthi gladiat film enough fact make everlast favourit genr fan worthi academi award acknowledg receivedin narr term plot stori arc simplic suprem someth scott russel crow never shi away knowledg well never denial debt gladiat owe anthoni mann epic fall roman empir folk seem irrit strang maker gladiat stand bold brass proclaim uniqu movi reinvigor stagnant genr film new gener audienc bloodi work influenc interest thing roman histor swashbuckl film follow post gladiat success seewhat life echo eternityso origin stori cgi hardli grade stuff there littl mug act support rank cast struggl grasp period set requir yet way gladiat make emot commit feel overrid film make irk crow maximu man men want man woman want run gamut life pain emot fortifi trial tribul everi step way urg toward day reveng splatter destini crow superb everi pain frame win academi award best actor insid previou year'], [\"I watched this movie in 2000 in a movie theater.

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don\\'t mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he\\'s most praised for: Gladiator. I\\'ve had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I\\'m disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I\\'ll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There\\'s the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can\\'t connect. I\\'ve been laying blame on the film\\'s tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus\\' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she\\'s almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she\\'s not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus\\' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she\\'s never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer\\'s and Lisa Gerrard\\'s rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There\\'s a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it\\'s the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn\\'t matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there\\'s this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we\\'re supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It\\'s a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It\\'s mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There\\'s a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott\\'s penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I\\'m using smoke machines, and it\\'s all Ridley Scott\\'s fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that\\'s unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film\\'s honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It\\'s a weird story, man. I don\\'t think it really works, but it\\'s well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That\\'s far from nothing.', 'let prefac mention someth ridley scott fanboy hold probabl higher pantheon modern filmmak dont mind admit howev one film seem step direct audienc feel neg toward posit probabl one film he prais gladiat ive sever view past coupl decad begin sort im disengag larg swath film think write downth stori spanish gener maximu russel crow built well ill say script john logan david franzoni william nicholson structur point need tell stori reveng there earli glori emperor marcu aureliu richard harri unjust fall hand commodu joaquin phoenix rebirth gladiatori game provinc ownership proximo oliv reed revel back forth toward reveng end yet cant connect ive lay blame film tone recent view refin criticismfirstli tone remark dour bare happi moment throughout exceedingli rare leav rest film oppress sen dour root idea film bandi cours begin fact maximu famili murder corrupt emperor kill father gain throne think one center problem tone lucilla conni nielsen commodu sister maximu previou relationship year ago seem kind feminin respit masculin around she almost written like man outsid look she terribl feminin hard cold even begin given one moment smile laugh maximu expens otherwis much respit form miseri around even maximu she never potenti alli dark danger gameth time film lighten tone action sequenc gener pretti great scott qualiti action filmmak understand point spectacl achiev battl germania fight africa gladiatori bout coliseum expertli stage film film begin strong recreat roman battl tactic help han zimmer lisa gerrard rous score get lost dour tone machin roman senateand lead second main critic polit there point later commodu quizz lucilla peopl rome like distant victori repli glori rome idea definit larger plot film return glori rome preimperi state republ without emperor okay fine never make case preimperi state better way current state never dig maximu care beyond fact die wish marcu aureliu would real one want doesnt matter movieand lead think core issu film maximu strong reason want plot actual want reveng commodu enough there effort wrap effort senat led gracchu derek jacobi commodu return power senat pervers incent commodu point suppos ignor reason maximu care marcu aureliu told care essenti real disconnect film present charact interact plot film never actual reconcilesand yet think film pretti okay mostli spectacl front give film full mark look great begin end there painterli approach visual help small part scott penchant use smoke machin everywher ever make film im use smoke machin ridley scott fault action scene topnotch perform everyon commit effect special mention phoenix goe commodu demonstr descent mad paranoia welli engag stori much weird combin superseri roman polit assum presumpt like shout democraci crowd expect cheer odd disconnect main charact plot that unfold around know film legion fan will go arena defend film honor anyon would besmirch besmirch done weird stori man dont think realli work wellmad fun spot look great that far noth'], [\"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing.

Photography is incredible, please pay atention for the scene when Russel Crowe rises to the arena as the roses fall, simply stunning.

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Plenty of realistic sword fighting duels, compared to most action films anyway, with an immense storyline that makes you passionate about supporting Maximus in avenging his family. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix suit the roles perfectly as hero and villain, with a simple yet effective story that keeps you engaged. There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself. I feel like injured or not, no one in their right mind would've taken the decision to fight him 1 to 1, so for a cunning character, I feel he made an unrealistic decision there, but it did make for a very entertaining finish. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Russell Crowe is just perfect casting he's no eighties buff action hero but you know he can hold his own in a fair fight and commands respect every minute he's on screen even by his enemies. Then there is the supporting cast Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Connie Nelson, Djimon Hounsou and Joaquin Phoenix. They hold their own and add to the story but give some some of the best lines ever said in a film. It's a rare film because everything from the cast to the costumes fit perfectly.Wow what can I say I've seen this film a number of times and it's a rare beast they just don't make these anymore or never did. If u want to watch a film about the Roman empire set in the gladiator arena of the ancient colosseum there is nothing like it or as good in over a hundred years of cinema. Better than spartacus and Ben hur well I salute u I was truly entertained. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "54. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

And Phoenix as the antogonist of Crowe delivers a strong performance. It is a big screen Experience, but on your TV at home also very much watchable. The director is a caeser for shooting such beautiful material. Some piece are like a painting (explample the fight in Rome where the tijgers are chained). Lots of widescreenshots in Zuccabar, the dessert make the move like a classic. And Hans zimmer made an unforgettable soundtrack together with the lovely voice of Lisa Gerrard.

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "63. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "83. The movie \"Gladiator\" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed \"Aliens\" and was equally impressive. The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character's emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding.

            "84. Gladiator is a historical epic directed by ridley scott. Person I find ridley Scott to be really overrated but this movie could probably be considered a masterpiece. Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Incredible story of one man which served in Roman army, this movie shows the gladiator lives how they struggle too survive, how they fight, fear, anger and lot more. The mighty arena of Rome, Coliseum is also seen in this movie it show how mighty was ancient Rome. I recommend this movie for everyone who likes history, action and adventure.

            "87. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "107. The movie \"Gladiator\" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed \"Aliens\" and was equally impressive. The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character's emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding. The end of the movie is just fantastic and it leaves a lasting impression.Overall, \"Gladiator\" is an action-packed movie with terrific acting and an engaging story. It's definitely worth watching and is a fantastic film. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Incredible story of one man which served in Roman army, this movie shows the gladiator lives how they struggle too survive, how they fight, fear, anger and lot more.

            "111. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

            "150. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "159. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "174. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix.

            "183. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Russell Crowe is just perfect casting he's no eighties buff action hero but you know he can hold his own in a fair fight and commands respect every minute he's on screen even by his enemies. Then there is the supporting cast Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Connie Nelson, Djimon Hounsou and Joaquin Phoenix. They hold their own and add to the story but give some some of the best lines ever said in a film. It's a rare film because everything from the cast to the costumes fit perfectly.Wow what can I say I've seen this film a number of times and it's a rare beast they just don't make these anymore or never did.

            "198. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight.

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

            "207. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "222. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

And Phoenix as the antogonist of Crowe delivers a strong performance. It is a big screen Experience, but on your TV at home also very much watchable. The director is a caeser for shooting such beautiful material. Some piece are like a painting (explample the fight in Rome where the tijgers are chained).

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "231. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight.

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "255. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then.

            "276. Gladiator is a historical epic directed by ridley scott. Person I find ridley Scott to be really overrated but this movie could probably be considered a masterpiece. Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10. - Similarity: 0.00\n",
            "277. Rarely do you see a movie like this. Rarely.For me this movie is nearly on par with The Shawshank Redemption and is actually a little bit ahead of Interstellar. However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Incredible story of one man which served in Roman army, this movie shows the gladiator lives how they struggle too survive, how they fight, fear, anger and lot more. The mighty arena of Rome, Coliseum is also seen in this movie it show how mighty was ancient Rome. I recommend this movie for everyone who likes history, action and adventure.

            "279. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that.

And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "318. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "327. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "342. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight.

Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

            "351. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

            "366. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

The director is a caeser for shooting such beautiful material. Some piece are like a painting (explample the fight in Rome where the tijgers are chained).

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight.

Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

            "375. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "390. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter.

            "396. Gladiator is a historical epic directed by ridley scott. Person I find ridley Scott to be really overrated but this movie could probably be considered a masterpiece. Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Incredible story of one man which served in Roman army, this movie shows the gladiator lives how they struggle too survive, how they fight, fear, anger and lot more.

            "399. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",
            "400. The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix.

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "423. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Russel Crowe was took as a main actor for this movie, and I think no one is disappointed for that. Incredible story of one man which served in Roman army, this movie shows the gladiator lives how they struggle too survive, how they fight, fear, anger and lot more. The mighty arena of Rome, Coliseum is also seen in this movie it show how mighty was ancient Rome. I recommend this movie for everyone who likes history, action and adventure. This is on of the best movies of all time. - Similarity: 0.00\n",
            "447. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",
            "448. The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "471. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "486. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "495. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Plenty of realistic sword fighting duels, compared to most action films anyway, with an immense storyline that makes you passionate about supporting Maximus in avenging his family. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix suit the roles perfectly as hero and villain, with a simple yet effective story that keeps you engaged. There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself. I feel like injured or not, no one in their right mind would've taken the decision to fight him 1 to 1, so for a cunning character, I feel he made an unrealistic decision there, but it did make for a very entertaining finish. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "510. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight.

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

            "519. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

            "534. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

And Phoenix as the antogonist of Crowe delivers a strong performance. It is a big screen Experience, but on your TV at home also very much watchable. The director is a caeser for shooting such beautiful material. Some piece are like a painting (explample the fight in Rome where the tijgers are chained).

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

            "543. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "558. Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight.

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

            "567. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

The recreation of ancient Rome is meticulous and immersive, transporting the audience to the heart of the Roman Colosseum, with its grand spectacles and brutal gladiatorial combat. The action sequences are choreographed with a brutal elegance, capturing the sheer savagery of the era.Hans Zimmer's score is both haunting and rousing, perfectly complementing the film's grand scale and emotional depth. The script, while taking some historical liberties, delivers powerful dialogue and memorable lines that have since become iconic.\"Gladiator\" is more than a simple tale of revenge; it explores themes of power, corruption, and the human spirit's resilience. The film's climax is both tragic and uplifting, leaving viewers with a profound sense of catharsis.In conclusion, \"Gladiator\" stands as a monumental achievement in filmmaking, combining a compelling story, strong performances, stunning visuals, and a memorable score.

            "587. The movie \"Gladiator\" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed \"Aliens\" and was equally impressive. The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character's emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding. The end of the movie is just fantastic and it leaves a lasting impression.Overall, \"Gladiator\" is an action-packed movie with terrific acting and an engaging story. It's definitely worth watching and is a fantastic film. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Incredible story of one man which served in Roman army, this movie shows the gladiator lives how they struggle too survive, how they fight, fear, anger and lot more.

            "591. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly \"Grade A\" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting \"Democracy\" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing. - Similarity: 0.00\n",
            "616. The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations. - Similarity: 0.00\n",
            "617. Gladiator\" is an epic masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Set against the backdrop of ancient Rome, Ridley Scott's magnum opus immerses viewers in a world of political intrigue, betrayal, and the quest for justice.I've seen this movie for 5 times and don't mind to watch it again. Russell Crowe delivers a tour de force performance as Maximus, a general turned gladiator seeking vengeance against the corrupt emperor who murdered his family and betrayed him.With its compelling characters, powerful themes of honor and redemption, and iconic moments that linger long after the credits roll, \"Gladiator\" stands as a timeless classic and a testament to the enduring power of cinema. 10/10. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

Let's just say I'm mind blown by this movie everything from the start to the end I've been in love with it because I like learning about history and culture specially Italian history and this movie was it I enjoyed watching the fight scenes and the emotional moments I felt like I was risking to the heavens specially at the end with the soundtrack this is the part which broke my heart and I will always remember this movie because of that specific moment. This is how movies should always be a fantastic story and ending I enjoyed every second of it and I'll watch it again in the near future OMG what a masterpiece. - Similarity: 0.00\n",
            "619. This movie is in my opinion, the best movie of all times. There is not a single thing that this movie does not execute very near to perfection. This epic is defnitly a must watch. Costume design is perfect, even i want to dress like Joaquin Phoenix as the emperor. Music is beautiful, i will just say: Hans Zimmer and Enya. Photography is incredible, please pay atention for the scene when Russel Crowe rises to the arena as the roses fall, simply stunning. History and plot work very well, as you empathyse with the protagonist. Choreography for the fights are very good, memorable caracthers and dialogue lines that are remembered even today, many years later. Do i have to say more? Are you not entertained? - Similarity: 0.00\n",
            "620. Starts as a war epic that is reminiscent of some classics of the past, the opening scene is absolutely spectacular. Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer. - Similarity: 0.00\n",
            "621. Yes I was entertained Maximus. Plenty of realistic sword fighting duels, compared to most action films anyway, with an immense storyline that makes you passionate about supporting Maximus in avenging his family. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix suit the roles perfectly as hero and villain, with a simple yet effective story that keeps you engaged. There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself. I feel like injured or not, no one in their right mind would've taken the decision to fight him 1 to 1, so for a cunning character, I feel he made an unrealistic decision there, but it did make for a very entertaining finish. - Similarity: 0.00\n",

The scenery is breathtaking, the story we'll written. And the ending, ohh the ending was just the kind this movie needs. (A little predictable though:)I just adore the parts where there's fighting and yelling and swords clashing and we just get teleported into a field of wheat...Scott makes keeps the pace just the way we want it to be, scenes with action, fighting, blood everywhere, followed by slow, sad thoughtfully moments.Aaaaand it's got so many great quotes.WE NEED MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS!!! - Similarity: 0.00\n",
            "623. First off this has one of the best movie opening in the history of cinema it starts off truly epic and unleashes sheer visual brilliance that does not let up for over 2 hours. Russell Crowe is just perfect casting he's no eighties buff action hero but you know he can hold his own in a fair fight and commands respect every minute he's on screen even by his enemies. Then there is the supporting cast Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Connie Nelson, Djimon Hounsou and Joaquin Phoenix. They hold their own and add to the story but give some some of the best lines ever said in a film. It's a rare film because everything from the cast to the costumes fit perfectly.Wow what can I say I've seen this film a number of times and it's a rare beast they just don't make these anymore or never did. If u want to watch a film about the Roman empire set in the gladiator arena of the ancient colosseum there is nothing like it or as good in over a hundred years of cinema. Better than spartacus and Ben hur well I salute u I was truly entertained. - Similarity: 0.00\n",
