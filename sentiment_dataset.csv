Plenty of realistic sword fighting duels, compared to most action films anyway, with an immense storyline that makes you passionate about supporting Maximus in avenging his family. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix suit the roles perfectly as hero and villain, with a simple yet effective story that keeps you engaged. There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

14,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",negative
15,"I watched this movie in 2000 in a movie theater. Since then I watch it almost every year. It's still very much entertaining. And Phoenix as the antogonist of Crowe delivers a strong performance. It is a big screen Experience, but on your TV at home also very much watchable. The director is a caeser for shooting such beautiful material. Some piece are like a painting (explample the fight in Rome where the tijgers are chained). Lots of widescreenshots in Zuccabar, the dessert make the move like a classic. And Hans zimmer made an unforgettable soundtrack together with the lovely voice of Lisa Gerrard. Hail Ridley Scott, Hail Gladiator!",neutral

19,"The movie ""Gladiator"" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed ""Aliens"" and was equally impressive. The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character's emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding. The end of the movie is just fantastic and it leaves a lasting impression.Overall, ""Gladiator"" is an action-packed movie with terrific acting and an engaging story. It's definitely worth watching and is a fantastic film.",positive
20,"Gladiator is a historical epic directed by ridley scott. Person I find ridley Scott to be really overrated but this movie could probably be considered a masterpiece. Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",neutral
21,"Rarely do you see a movie like this. Rarely.For me this movie is nearly on par with The Shawshank Redemption and is actually a little bit ahead of Interstellar. However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",positive

Russel Crowe was took as a main actor for this movie, and I think no one is disappointed for that. Incredible story of one man which served in Roman army, this movie shows the gladiator lives how they struggle too survive, how they fight, fear, anger and lot more. The mighty arena of Rome, Coliseum is also seen in this movie it show how mighty was ancient Rome. I recommend this movie for everyone who likes history, action and adventure. This is on of the best movies of all time.",negative
23,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",neutral
24,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",negative

44,"The movie ""Gladiator"" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed ""Aliens"" and was equally impressive. The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter.

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",positive

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",negative

This is on of the best movies of all time.",neutral
48,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative
49,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",negative

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",neutral

Plenty of realistic sword fighting duels, compared to most action films anyway, with an immense storyline that makes you passionate about supporting Maximus in avenging his family. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix suit the roles perfectly as hero and villain, with a simple yet effective story that keeps you engaged. There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

This is on of the best movies of all time.",negative
73,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",positive
74,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",neutral

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",neutral

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience.

Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",negative

Russel Crowe was took as a main actor for this movie, and I think no one is disappointed for that. Incredible story of one man which served in Roman army, this movie shows the gladiator lives how they struggle too survive, how they fight, fear, anger and lot more. The mighty arena of Rome, Coliseum is also seen in this movie it show how mighty was ancient Rome. I recommend this movie for everyone who likes history, action and adventure. This is on of the best movies of all time.",neutral
98,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative

There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",positive

104,"Starts as a war epic that is reminiscent of some classics of the past, the opening scene is absolutely spectacular. Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",neutral

Plenty of realistic sword fighting duels, compared to most action films anyway, with an immense storyline that makes you passionate about supporting Maximus in avenging his family. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix suit the roles perfectly as hero and villain, with a simple yet effective story that keeps you engaged. There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself. I feel like injured or not, no one in their right mind would've taken the decision to fight him 1 to 1, so for a cunning character, I feel he made an unrealistic decision there, but it did make for a very entertaining finish.",negative

114,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",neutral

139,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",positive

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix.

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

148,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",positive

164,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",positive

Some piece are like a painting (explample the fight in Rome where the tijgers are chained). Lots of widescreenshots in Zuccabar, the dessert make the move like a classic.

169,"The movie ""Gladiator"" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed ""Aliens"" and was equally impressive.

170,"Gladiator is a historical epic directed by ridley scott. Person I find ridley Scott to be really overrated but this movie could probably be considered a masterpiece. Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",positive

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",positive

173,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",neutral
174,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",negative

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption.

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",positive

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",neutral

This is on of the best movies of all time.",negative
198,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",neutral
199,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",positive

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",neutral

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",neutral
221,"Rarely do you see a movie like this. Rarely.For me this movie is nearly on par with The Shawshank Redemption and is actually a little bit ahead of Interstellar. However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",positive

The mighty arena of Rome, Coliseum is also seen in this movie it show how mighty was ancient Rome. I recommend this movie for everyone who likes history, action and adventure. This is on of the best movies of all time.",neutral
223,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative
224,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",positive

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",neutral

Plenty of realistic sword fighting duels, compared to most action films anyway, with an immense storyline that makes you passionate about supporting Maximus in avenging his family. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix suit the roles perfectly as hero and villain, with a simple yet effective story that keeps you engaged. There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

239,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",neutral

264,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",neutral

273,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man.

289,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",negative

Some piece are like a painting (explample the fight in Rome where the tijgers are chained). Lots of widescreenshots in Zuccabar, the dessert make the move like a classic.

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",negative

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",positive

This is on of the best movies of all time.",positive
298,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative
299,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",neutral

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",negative

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix.

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

323,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",neutral
324,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high.

Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",neutral

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix.

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

348,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",positive
349,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",negative

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

364,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",positive

The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much.

389,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",positive

398,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much.

I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man.

414,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",negative

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",negative

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

This is on of the best movies of all time.",positive
423,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative
424,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",positive

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",positive

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",negative

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

This is on of the best movies of all time.",neutral
448,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",positive
449,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",negative

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix.

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

This is on of the best movies of all time.",negative
473,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative
474,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",negative

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",positive

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

489,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",positive

It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative

514,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",positive

523,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault).

539,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",negative

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",neutral

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

This is on of the best movies of all time.",positive
548,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",neutral
549,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",positive

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",neutral

569,"The movie ""Gladiator"" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed ""Aliens"" and was equally impressive.

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",neutral

However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",neutral

This is on of the best movies of all time.",positive
573,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",positive
574,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",negative

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",neutral

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

594,"The movie ""Gladiator"" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed ""Aliens"" and was equally impressive. The film is centered around Maximus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who is a gladiator and fighter. His acting in the movie is fantastic and he portrays the character's emotions and feelings perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Emperor Commodus is also outstanding, and he deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the character. He fits the role perfectly and has the perfect charisma.The story of the film is captivating and it starts with a great picture and an action sequence. The first half-hour may be a bit dull, but the film becomes fantastic as it progresses. The epic arena fights are superbly inspired and the camera work is outstanding. The end of the movie is just fantastic and it leaves a lasting impression.Overall, ""Gladiator"" is an action-packed movie with terrific acting and an engaging story. It's definitely worth watching and is a fantastic film.",positive
595,"Gladiator is a historical epic directed by ridley scott. Person I find ridley Scott to be really overrated but this movie could probably be considered a masterpiece. Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",negative
596,"Rarely do you see a movie like this. Rarely.For me this movie is nearly on par with The Shawshank Redemption and is actually a little bit ahead of Interstellar. However, what do all of these films have in common? Other than them all being in my top 3 of all time, they contain a very powerful story. Many, many movies are good. In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",negative

The mighty arena of Rome, Coliseum is also seen in this movie it show how mighty was ancient Rome. I recommend this movie for everyone who likes history, action and adventure. This is on of the best movies of all time.",positive
598,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative
599,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",neutral

604,"Starts as a war epic that is reminiscent of some classics of the past, the opening scene is absolutely spectacular. Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption. That part ends with the Caesar dead and Maximus a slave, leading to two story arcs that will inevitably meet: Maximus' revenge odyssey and Commodus' grand vision to make Rome great.The action scenes have the Hollywood touch, the hero always prevails, but they are entertaining nonetheless, even though the ending is too feel-good. Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",negative

Plenty of realistic sword fighting duels, compared to most action films anyway, with an immense storyline that makes you passionate about supporting Maximus in avenging his family. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix suit the roles perfectly as hero and villain, with a simple yet effective story that keeps you engaged. There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself. I feel like injured or not, no one in their right mind would've taken the decision to fight him 1 to 1, so for a cunning character, I feel he made an unrealistic decision there, but it did make for a very entertaining finish.",positive

Then there is the supporting cast Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Connie Nelson, Djimon Hounsou and Joaquin Phoenix.

614,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",positive

Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative

639,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",negative

648,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end.

664,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",negative

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix.

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

673,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",neutral
674,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",negative

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",positive

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

698,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative
699,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",positive

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",positive

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

723,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",positive

Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",positive

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",negative

And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative

Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",positive

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

764,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",positive

789,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",neutral

794,"The movie ""Gladiator"" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed ""Aliens"" and was equally impressive.

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix.

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",neutral

798,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",neutral
799,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",negative

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",positive

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",neutral

This is on of the best movies of all time.",positive
823,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",negative
824,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",neutral

Then we see Rome's ugly side in all its glory: behind the scene politics, conspiracies, corruption.

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",negative

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

848,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",neutral
849,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",positive

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",positive

This is on of the best movies of all time.",positive
873,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",positive

Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",neutral

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

889,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",neutral

914,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",negative

Some piece are like a painting (explample the fight in Rome where the tijgers are chained). Lots of widescreenshots in Zuccabar, the dessert make the move like a classic.

919,"The movie ""Gladiator"" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed ""Aliens"" and was equally impressive.

Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix.

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

923,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",positive
924,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",positive

Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.",neutral

944,"The movie ""Gladiator"" from 2000 is a true masterpiece created specifically for the cinema. It was directed by Ridley Scott, who had previously directed ""Aliens"" and was equally impressive.

Russel crowe gave what is probably his second best preformance ever as maximus decides meridious, would have been much better if he started singing though.Can't say I've hated a character as passionately as I hated commodus in a while. Which honestly made him a pretty great villian especially since I love joaquin pheonix. The only real issue I had with this movie qas that I really didn't like the camera work in a couple scenes in which I believe the camera moved too quickly between shots thus kind of taking away from the fight. Still a phenomenal movie though. 9.8/10.",positive

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",positive

948,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",neutral
949,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",positive

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",negative

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus.

This is on of the best movies of all time.",neutral
973,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",positive

Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well.

Plus the focus isn't entirely on the adventure, it's also about the two main characters and the conflict between them.And the characters do come to life thanks to great performances by Russell Crowe as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus (the scene where Maximus finds his wife and son murdered and especially the one where Commodus finds out that he isn't the chosen one of his father are some good examples).Very successful job in terms of set design, the movie looks, smells and breathes like ancient Rome.Iconic soundtrack thanks to Hans Zimmer.",negative

There's not much the film could do better, which might seem the rating is a tad harsh, however this might be because of the villain himself.

In fact, there are even a lot that are great. But Gladiator is simply incredible. The stunning combination of all of this movie's attributes combine together to make it almost perfect. Gladiator not only 'manages' to contain action, some humor, and a lot of intensity, it excels in being great because of these things. Another one of the very notable things about this movie is the main character, Maximus. Not only is he very likable and easily relatable, but his character development almost makes it so the viewer grows with him.In the end, Gladiator is an absolute must-watch.10/10 - Highly, Highly Recommend.",neutral
997,"This is all time best movie for me. The gladiators, assassins, history, politics, mighty man an lot more in this one movie. Russel Crowe was took as a main actor for this movie, and I think no one is disappointed for that. Incredible story of one man which served in Roman army, this movie shows the gladiator lives how they struggle too survive, how they fight, fear, anger and lot more. The mighty arena of Rome, Coliseum is also seen in this movie it show how mighty was ancient Rome. I recommend this movie for everyone who likes history, action and adventure. This is on of the best movies of all time.",negative
998,"Let me preface this by mentioning that I am something of a Ridley Scott fanboy. I hold him up probably higher than I should in the pantheon of modern filmmakers, and I don't mind admitting it. However, the one film that I seem out of step on in the other direction than most audiences, feeling more negatively towards it than positive, is probably the one film that he's most praised for: Gladiator. I've had several viewings over the past couple of decades to begin to sort through why I'm disengaged through large swaths of the film, and I think I can write them down.The story of the Spanish General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is built well, I'll say that. The script by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson has all of the structural points it needs to tell this story of revenge. There's the early glory under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the unjust fall at the hands of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the rebirth through gladiatorial games in the provinces under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed), the revelation, and the back and forth towards revenge in the end. And yet, I just can't connect. I've been laying blame on the film's tone for a while, but this recent viewing has refined some more of my criticism.Firstly, that tone is remarkably dour. There are a bare few happy moments throughout, but they are exceedingly rare, leaving most of the rest of the film with this oppressive sense of dourness rooted in a few ideas the film is bandying about. Of course the beginning of all that is the fact that Maximus has had his family murdered by a corrupt emperor who killed his own father to gain the throne. I think one of the centers of my problem with tone is Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Commodus' sister. She and Maximus had a previous relationship years ago, and she seems to be some kind of feminine respite from the masculinity around her, but she's almost written like a man. Outside of her look, she's not terribly feminine, hard and cold even in the beginning, given one moment to smile and laugh (at Maximus' expense) but is otherwise not much of a respite in any form from the misery around her. Even for Maximus, she's never more than a potential ally in a dark and dangerous game.The only time this film lightens up with its tone is in its action sequences, and those are generally pretty great. Scott is a quality action filmmaker who understands the point of spectacle and how to achieve it, and the battle in Germania, the fights in Africa, and the gladiatorial bouts in the Coliseum are all expertly staged and filmed. So, the film begins strong with its recreation of Roman battle tactics, helped by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's rousing score, and then it just gets lost in the dour tone and machinations of the Roman Senate.And that leads me to me second main criticism: the politics. There's a point later when Commodus is quizzing Lucilla about what the people of Rome like about distant victories, and she replies the Glory of Rome which is an idea (her definition). The larger plot of this film is about the return of the Glory of Rome to its pre-Imperial state as a Republic without an emperor. Okay, fine. It never, not once, makes the case that the pre-Imperial state was better in any way than the current state. It never once digs into how or why Maximus himself should care beyond the fact that it's the dying wish of Marcus Aurelius (would the real one have wanted it? Doesn't matter, this is just a movie).And that leads me to what I think is the core of my issues with this film: Maximus has no strong reason to want what the plot is actually about. He wants revenge against Commodus, which should be enough, but then there's this effort to wrap him up with this effort by the Senate, led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to have Commodus return power to the Senate (a perverse incentive that Commodus points out and we're supposed to ignore for some reason). But why does Maximus care? Because Marcus Aurelius told him to care, essentially. It's a real disconnect in how the film presents its characters and how they interact with the plot that the film never actually reconciles.And yet, I think the film is pretty okay. It's mostly a spectacle, and on that front, I give the film full marks. It looks great from beginning to end. There's a painterly approach to the visuals, helped in no small part by Scott's penchant for using smoke machines everywhere (if I ever make a film myself, I'm using smoke machines, and it's all Ridley Scott's fault). The action scenes are all top-notch. The performances from everyone are committed and effective with special mention to Phoenix who goes all in as Commodus, demonstrating his descent into a mad paranoia well.I just do not engage with the story very much. It is this weird combination of super-seriousness, Roman politics, assumed presumptions (like shouting ""Democracy"" in a crowd and expecting a cheer), and an odd disconnect between the main character and the plot that's unfolding around him. I know the film has legions of fans, all willing to go into the arena to defend the film's honor from anyone who would besmirch it, but besmirch it I have done. It's a weird story, man. I don't think it really works, but it's well-made, fun in spots, and looks great. That's far from nothing.",neutral
999,"The movie is a masterclass in acting, casting, direction and writing. The performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix set the bar extremely high. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the movie's run-time, the plot is very well written with a proper backstory to define the protagonist's vengeful motives. Despite the long run time of the movie it never feels elongated and takes just the perfect amount of time to convey the story. The violent scenes in the movie are a scary reminder of the brutalism that used to exist in the not so recent past, the fights in the movie feel realistic although the protagonist is always shown to have a slight edge however it is thoroughly justified as we get to see his past as well. The movie more than deserves the five Oscars it received and its sequel coming in 2024 shall go against a very high bar in term of the audience's expectations.",negative
